# Project Rules for MiniSocialNetwork

## Communication Style
- **LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT**: ALWAYS communicate with the user in **Vietnamese** (Tiếng Việt).
- This applies to all responses, explanations, and questions.

## Backend Modification Policy

**CRITICAL:** Backend code requires explicit approval before ANY modifications.

### Rules:
1. **READ ONLY by default** - All `.cs` files in `e:\PersonalProject\SocialNetwork\MiniSocialNetwork\`
2. **MUST ASK** before:
   - Modifying Controllers, Services, Repositories
   - Changing API endpoints
   - Updating Entity models
   - Adding/removing files
   - Database migrations

3. **ALLOWED without asking:**
   - Reading/analyzing backend code
   - Explaining how backend works
   - Suggesting improvements (but don't implement)

### Workflow for Backend Changes:
```
Step 1: Analyze and propose: "I see we could add X to CommentsController. Should I?"
Step 2: Wait for explicit approval: "OK, do it" / "No, keep it as is"
Step 3: Only then make changes
```

### Frontend:
- ✅ Free to modify (proactive fixes allowed)
- ⚠️ Unless user explicitly says otherwise

## Realtime & SignalR Policy
- **FOLDER REQUIREMENT**: All code related to SignalR/Realtime functionality MUST be located in `js/realtime/`.
- **ISOLATION REQUIREMENT**: SignalR features must be implemented as "Experimental" or "Optional". The application MUST remain fully functional even if the entire `js/realtime/` folder is deleted or if the SignalR scripts are removed from `index.html`.
- **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINE**: Always use defensive checks (e.g., `if (window.PostHub)`) before calling any realtime functions from other parts of the application.
